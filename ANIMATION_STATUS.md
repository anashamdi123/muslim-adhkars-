## 🎯 **Animation Summary by Type**

| Animation Type | Used In | Effect |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| **fade** | Prayers, Tasbih | Smooth opacity transition |
| **slideUp** | Adhkar List | Slides from bottom to top |
| **slideLeft** | Dhikr Detail | Slides from right to left |

## 🔄 **Re-animation Behavior**

All screens now use `useFocusEffect` to re-trigger animations:

✅ **First Visit** → Animations play  
✅ **Navigate Away** → State preserved  
✅ **Return to Screen** → **Animations replay!** 🎬  
✅ **Quick Switching** → Smooth, no lag  
✅ **Deep Navigation** → Works perfectly  

---

## 🚀 **Performance Characteristics**

### **Optimizations Applied:**
1. **UI Thread Execution** - All animations use Reanimated worklets
2. **Smart Cancellation** - Prevents conflicts on rapid navigation
3. **Lazy Loading** - Screens load only when needed
4. **Proper Cleanup** - No memory leaks

### **Expected Performance:**
- **Frame Rate:** 60fps consistently
- **Animation Duration:** 300-600ms (feels instant)
- **Stagger Delays:** 80-100ms (smooth cascade)
- **CPU Impact:** Minimal (UI thread execution)
- **Memory Footprint:** Low (efficient cleanup)
